# Warfactory 2

Repository for the Warfactory 2 Modpack, go to the discord as not much is here atm https://discord.gg/ker7z7KCf2

## Playing

The pack is technically playable, but it's not really suitable for survival atm, if you want to play it go build the pack you skid

## Building

**Don't forget to add CurseForge api key to environment variables** `export CFAPIKEY=yourkey`.
To build you will need python3 (dependencies will be resolved in runtime). Run `./build/main.py`
