# Warfactory 2

Repository for the Warfactory 2 Modpack, go to the discord as not much is here atm https://discord.gg/ker7z7KCf2

## Playing

The pack is technically playable but it's not really suitable for survival atm, if you want to play it go build the pack you skid

## Building

You need `Python3` and `Python Requests` installed. Building is done through running the `main.py` script.
